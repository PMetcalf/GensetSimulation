# UK Electricity Grid Analytics

This data acquisition and analysis project involves collecting, analysing and visualising electrical generation data from UK power networks via Elexon's BMRS API.

Electrical generation from different generation assets is collected and analysed to identify contributions from renewable and non-renewable sources, statistics for each generation type and characterisation of generation profiles.
