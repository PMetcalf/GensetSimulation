# UK Electricity Grid Analytics

This data acquisition and analysis project involves collecting, analysing and visualising electrical generation data from UK power networks via Elexon's BMRS API.

Electrical generation from different generation assets is collected and analysed to identify contributions from renewable and non-renewable sources, statistics for each generation type and characterisation of generation profiles. The UK energy grid mix contains a wide-ranging mix of generation types, from nuclear and fossil fuels through to solar, wind and hydro. Each of the different generation types produces different quantities of electricity for the UK market, and does so using different profiles.

This project seeks to understand and characterise the generation of power from different assets.

Project Structure
---

This is an end-to-end acquisition, storage, analysis and visualisation project with elements of the technology stack built for each function, and the project contains a dashboard displaying electricity generation data.

The project is divided into a series folders, each focused on a different element of the data pipeline:

- **Data Acquisition:** Acquisition script for requesting data for BMRS API, and database API for data storage and retrieval.
  
- **Data Analytics:** Jupyter notebooks and supporting source code for data exploration and analysis.

- **Web App:** Dashboard for displaying data trends and summary statistics.
